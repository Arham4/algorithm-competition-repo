# CHS's Algorithm Competition Repository

This repository contains source code to all the competitions the Centennial High School UIL Computer Science Team 
participated in. At moments the UIL team was not together, the team [Arham Siddiqui](https://github.com/Arham4) 
participated with had their source code put in to this repository.

## Setup
To set the source code for a respective competition, clone the repository (or download the repository as a ZIP using
by the GitHub interface) and make a new project using the existing source code at a folder. Each competition folder is
designed in a way to allow for one to simply create a project and start programming. 

Data input files are placed at the root of each competition folder as per how IntelliJ's file input stream routes to reading 
them. It is important to acknowledge that many IDEs, such as BlueJ and Eclipse, have their file input stream route to the 
`src` directory rather than the root of the project, so proper measures must be taken to counter a `FileNotFoundException`.
